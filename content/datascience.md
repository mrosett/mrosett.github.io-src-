Machine learning is a powerful tool. But as I survey the landscape of data science across conferences, articles, and discussions, I'm perplexed to see machine learning treated as if it is the whole of data science, rather than just one tool that data scientists deploy. At a recent data science conference I attended, the majority of sessions (and an overwhelming majority of technical sessions) focused on machine learning or deep learning. Data science job postings invariably mention machine learning, and the Google results for "learn data science" are littered with references to the subject. This confusion inflicts harm on data scientists, aspiring data scientists, and employers. The result is wasted training, poorly designed projects, and 

Machine learning is to data science as massive tower cranes are to construction. There are very specific scenarios where a crane is exactly what you need to complete a project, and in those scenarios there's no real substitute. You can't build a skyscraper without one. Moreover, skyscrapers are really spectacular, and contracts to build them are worth a lot of money. But cranes are only required by a tiny fraction of construction projects, and even on those projects most of the work is done by people who aren't actually crane operators.

Similarly, many of the sexiest data science projects are built on machine learning. GPT-2 is really cool. Using gradient boosted trees to detect fraud is really valuable. But a shocking proportion of the value delivered by data scientists comes from capturing data, cleaning it, and calculating basic metrics.  Monica Rogati articulated this well in her article on the hierarchy of data science needs. Most companies need to focus 

In the best case scenario, an enthusiasm for machine learning 

A common failure mode for data scientists at small companies is poorly handling an executives enthusiasm for machine learning in scenarios where it's an inappropriate tool. If you'll permit me to indulge the crane metaphor once more, the result can look like a two-story shopping mall with a 40-story staircase to nowhere starting at the food court and ascending to the skies. 

This doesn't serve anyone well. 

 
That was a mistake, albeit an understandable one. The first place I encountered the term data science was on Kaggle, with its then-tagline of "Making a sport of data science." At the time their content solely consisted of supervised learning competitions. Data science was still a very amorphous field, and I didn't have the context to distinguish it from machine learning.

Data science now gets an order of magnitude more attention than it did five years ago. And yet I continue to see people conflating data science with machine learning. 

First, very few data scientists actually build machine learning models. I've worked as a data scientist or with data scientists at 4 different companies, and  

I see too many pieces written that treat machine learning as
