The last few years have been good ones for the "fact-checking" style of journalism, and how could it be any other way in an era where "fake news" has become a buzzword? Politicians have never been particularly concerned with factual details, and Trump certainly doesn't let minor details like the truth get in the way of a good story. And truth be told, I'm receptive to the rhetorical 

Fact-checkers use the word "fact" as an appeal to authority. Facts are indisputable, unambiguous, etc, so a journalist who calls himself a fact-checker assumes that authority. That might be justifiable if PolitiFact and company stuck to confirming that West Virginia has fewer STEM graduates than neighboring states ([True](https://www.politifact.com/west-virginia/statements/2019/apr/24/e-gordon-gee/does-west-virginia-trail-its-neighbors-stem-gradua/), in case you were wondering.) 

The *reducto ad absurdum* of the genre is the way fact-checkers handled Obama's famous declaration that under his healthcare law, "If you like your plan, you can keep it." At the time, the statement was rated [by whom?] as true; several years later, it was declared the lie of the year. Perhaps you read this simply as an indictment of how PolitiFact goes about things, but the anecdote reveals a deep flaw in the genre's premise.

This preys on a particular form of narcissism; partisans who are convinced that everyone would agree with them if only they had all the *facts.* 

The fact-checking style of journalism misses the point. We're not polarized because of lies or fake news; instead, lies find 

Most interesting statements aren't factual. The claim "My tax plan will grow the economy by four percent!" isn't. 

(As a side note, the tendency for people to talk about how we should use "AI" and "blockchain" to facilitate factchecking is a strong vote against it. )
