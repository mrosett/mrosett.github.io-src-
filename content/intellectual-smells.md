For software engineers, a "[code smell](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeSmell.html)" is a superficial pattern in a codebase that suggests the presence of significant, deeper problems. Recently, I've been thinking about "prose smells" that indicate a piece of writing is likely to contain a flawed argument. These prose smells aren't fallacies and don't directly invalidate an argument. (In theory, an article could have numerous prose smells and still be fundamentally correct.) Instead, they give a warning that trouble may lurk beneath the surface. 

In practice, prose smells have a couple uses. First, they indicate portions of an argument that are particularly likely to be weak. As a reader, that signals to tread carefully, while as a writer it illustrates which passages might need more attention. (Indeed, engineers primarily use code smells to recognize problems in their own code rather than in code written by others.

The second use is more specific to readers: prose smells can be a sign than an article isn't worth reading. 

Here are a few examples of prose smells:

**Buzzwords:** This is the most obvious example. There's some really good writing out there on AI or personalized medicine or inequality. But buzzwords signal trouble for two reasons. 

First, buzzwords lack clear definitions, so writing that relies on them frequently allows imprecise reasoning to creep in. 

Second, buzzwords can carry weak articles through various filters, both formal (an editor's approval) or informal (sharing/upvoting on social media.) If something with a less-than-scintillating title like [The APA Meeting: A Photo Essay](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/05/22/the-apa-meeting-a-photo-essay/) makes it through those filters and onto my reading list, then it's probably interesting (and indeed, you should read it). Conversely, there's an endless supply of articles on how the blockchain will revolutionize healthcare that contain no thought.

The word "buzzword" is perhaps itself a buzzword.

**Extraneous negative statements about the present:** Casual assertions about "today's uniquely challenging economy" or "the unprecedented spread of misinformation" and the like give authors a cheap way to generate urgency. They also tend to be imprecise - what does it mean for an economic environment to be "uniquely challenging"? - or even false. 

There are important negative trends that are worth highlighting - the rise in "deaths of despair" comes to mind - but invoking them as an easy way to get attention is a red flag. Note that this particular prose smell is present in my next paragraph.

**Unfamiliar Outrages** The straw man has evolved. Rather than arguing against a vague "they" or cherrypicking misleading quotes.   sign for the straw man fallacy. The simplest form of  A shocking number of published articles amount to "Two accounts with a combined 38 Twitter followers said something offensive." Call it the straw man for the modern age. Rather than 

**Compelling narratives** This one is counterintuitive and perhaps deserving of its own essay. Humans fundamentally understand the world through stories. Even when we're trying to carefully consider evidence,
