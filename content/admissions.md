College admissions lawsuits are inherently distasteful. Only rejected applicants can sue, and so the suits have the feeling trying to change the rules after you've lost the game. 

And yet we owe our gratitude to the students behind the recent lawsuit against Harvard which revealed just how rigged the rules of the game are. The admissions data Harvard released have been a gold mine for economists, and their conclusions are shocking. A recent analysis found that 43% of white students admitted to Harvard are "recruited athletes, legacies, those on the deanâ€™s interest list, and children of faculty and staff (ALDCs)". Furthermore, a staggering three-quarters of those students wouldn't be admitted on the basis of academic merit alone.

The corruption of the admissions process would surprise precisely nobody on an Ivy League campus, where the least academically-inclined students invariably share names with buildings or senators. (Full disclosure: I graduated from Yale, where I was a double legacy.) But the extent is staggering. The illusion of a meritocratic process with occasional exceptions has been shattered; clearly, admissions are a two-track game.

's too simplistic to claim that the ALDCs Harvard admits are unqualified.

Admitting the children of the wealthy and the well-connected certainly maximizes donations. It also maximizes the number of influential alumni; the son of a congressman is more likely to be elected president than an Asian who wants to major in physics.
