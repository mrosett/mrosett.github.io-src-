The Vietnam War is foreign to me.  My father was too young to be drafted, as he was in elementary school when the war ended. By the time I was that age, Vietnam had opened itself to foreign tourists. To my generation of Americans, Vietnam is an exotic vacation or perhaps somewhere to live for a year after college. 

Historical events fade from collective memory, but for the certified "bad war" the process is closer to an scrubbing. I only encounter the Vietnam War when I read the words "Vietnam Vet" scrawled in Sharpie on a homeless man's cardboard sign. World War II feels much closer, with Pearl Harbor, D-Day, and other anniversaries commemorated each year. There are no similar remembrances of the Vietnam War, and in truth I don't even know what days would be equivalent. When pressed, I can generate names like "The Gulf of Tonkin" and "Tet Offensive", but I don't understand the narrative of the war.

I first read the titular story of *The Things They Carried* as a high school freshman in my dad's English class, and I remembered the story clearly even before picking it up last month. Reading it this time had the jarring feeling of looking at something familiar with new eyes. To a fourteen-year-old, Lieutenant Jimmy Cross's obsession with Martha's virginity signified an adult proximity to sex that I could only imagine. Consciously, I recognized his folly in blaming himself for Ted Lavender's death. But how could I ascribe it to his youth and innocence when I possessed the same traits in greater quantity?

The stories are fiction, but, as O'Brien writes, "story-truth is sometimes truer than happening-truth." Grand strategy makes no appearance in this book about experience. I know nothing more of the Tet Offensive than before I read the book.  Instead, as the title promises, I know the burdens the burdens carried by the men of Alpha Company. They lived in fear of suddenly dying and with the moral disintegration driven by anxiety. And of course, they lived in the mud that's uniquitous in anti-war novels. 

O'Brien explicitly believes that the war was pointless and amoral, and that's clearly why he was still writing about the war twenty years after returning home. "A true war story is never moral," he writes, and without a moral, the story can't feel complete. He writes of characters who survived the war but never truly returned home, and that same alienation weights heavily on him.

The stories stood in stark constrast to how I spent my early adulthood, living the rarefied life of an Ivy League student rather than being shot at in the jungles of Vietnam. But the difference is not quite so clear. My own brush with mortality came when I was diagnosed with cancer at 20, and a quick glance at statistics suggests I was about 30 times more likely


> I'm interested in this collection of short stories for two reasons. First, the Vietnam War was a defining experience for a generation of Americans, and I don't know much about it. Second, I enjoy well-executed creative writing, and by all accounts this book fits that description.
